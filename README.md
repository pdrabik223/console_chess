this time I'm serius 


GR8
what now 

|**Idea**|**How hard it is**|**Where we are**|**What need's to be done first**|
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
|**Transformation tables**|manageable|it's kinda done<br> I mean it's there <br>but i need to test it more|test it , test the whole thing|
|**GUI**|not bad,<br> but a lot of work| I have it in console|better tool to draw stuff <br> in sfml or SDL|
|**castle**|I have a plan<br>one good night and it will be done|we have basic move done and working<br> so other moves are extension of simple one|I need to remember whether castle move has has been done|
|**en passant**|nightmare|not even the ground work|remember last move made<br>or detect if en passant can be made|
|**better png**|not at all|we are doing it a bit|it's separate thing it can be done anytime|
|**threads**|easy|ui is ready to accept new inputs| nothing, but this way of speeding up calculations doesn't really work in a long run|
