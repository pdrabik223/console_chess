this time I'm serius

GR8 what now

|**Idea**|**How hard it is**|**Where we are**|**What need's to be done first**|
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
|**Transformation tables**|manageable|it's kinda done<br> I mean it's there <br>but i need to test it more|test it , test the whole thing|
|**GUI**|now It's simple| the Gui is displaying basic info and can be interacted with (a bit), only thing missing is whole AI thing, but the same exact thing is already implemented but in console form |some gui way to enter settings and better board interaction, father class for all admin classes |
|**castle**|I have a plan<br>one good night and it will be done|we have basic move done and working<br> so other moves are extension of simple one|I need to remember whether castle move has has been done|
|**en passant**|nightmare|not even the ground work|remember last move made<br>or detect if en passant can be made|
|**better png**|not at all|we are doing it a bit|it's separate thing it can be done anytime|
|**threads**|easy|ui is ready to accept new inputs| nothing, but this way of speeding up calculations doesn't really work in a long run|
